Am sure we've all seen the movie 'Titanic'. And in the event you've been living in a crevice somewhere in the Himalayas, it a re-enactment of the fateful voyage of the world's largest sea vessel of its time (Ask someone else for the romance in the story. I'll suggest [Joy](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1139335180#!/profile.php?id=1139335180). Well, the ship sank 4 days into its maiden voyage and went to the bottom of the Atlantic taking about 1,517 souls along. History. The 1997 movie was a blast and stayed on top if the box office grossing charts for 12 years only recently taken down by Avatar.

Lets talk numbers. If you hate maths, never mind, I'll bring it down to you. It cost White Star Line $7.5 million to put the Titanic to sea in 1912. Yep, quite a sum back then. Guess how much the movie 'Titanic' grossed? About $1.84 billion. Yep! Billion with aÂ  B. Let's take that in for a moment. (*leans back and smiles with eyes closed*)

Ah! Do i see a hand at the back of the class? Inflation you ask? Well, even after adjusting for inflation and bringing both figures to a chosen year, it'll have cost $28.86 million to build the liner and the movie would have grossed $383.34 million! Yep! Now, class, a simple division yields 13.28 (to 2 s.f.). QED.

My point? The story of the failure of the ocean liner, Titanic, made about 13 times what it cost the owners to actually build it. White Star Line suffers a huge loss, James Cameron picks up the tale, underlines the romance with a bunch of good actors and with the 21st Century and other studios made a success out of a shipwreck.

The moral of the story?

Technology is meant to make life, in general, easier, worth the while and longer (in some cases). Many argue nothing new can be invented that only advancements can be made. It is only logical to try and solve the same old issues (even pre-1912) with cutting edge technology. Especially with Information and Communication Technology.

Technology drives commerce. According to the story line, no one saw the huge ocean liner sink in 1912, but with 1997's technology, millions lined up to the Titanic sinking afresh! It's time we looked at those age old 'shipwrecks' from a different angle, sprinkle in some innovation and find a way with today's technology. That's why we are here.
