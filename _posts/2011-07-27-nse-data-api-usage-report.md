It's been two weeks since we launched our Nigerian Stock Exchange data API. We decided to do some analytics on the API usage yesterday and to our amazement, we've received a total of **665 hits** on our API since launch on July 13th, 2011. Certainly some of this requests don't translate into valid requests. Here's a breakdown:




<table border="1" style="font-size:.8em; text-align:center;">
<tr>
	<th width="100" style="text-align:center">Response Type</th>
	<th width="100" style="text-align:center">Response Code</th>
	<th width="100" style="text-align:center">Hits</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>OK (Successful API requests)</td>
	<td>200</td>
	<td>410</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>OK (All successful requests)</td>
	<td>200</td>
	<td>439</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Forbidden (Unauthenticated Requests)</td>
	<td>403</td>
	<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>styleNot Found</td>
	<td>404</td>
	<td>182</td>
</tr>
</table>

The large number of _Not Found_ requests were generated by trojans making requests like /PhpMyAdmin and other such requests (they were probably looking for security loopholes).

Of the **23 API tokens** that have been provisioned, we have a **65% usage** on those keys. Here's a distribution of the requests we've received from those keys:




<table border="1" style="font-size:.8em; text-align:center;">
<tr>
	<th width="100" style="text-align:center">Request</th>
	<th width="100" style="text-align:center">Users</th>
	<th width="100" style="text-align:center">%</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>26%</td>

<tr>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>4</td>

In order to make the points in the chart fit within a reasonable chart size, the topmost dot was reduced.
