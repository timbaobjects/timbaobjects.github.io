For well over a year now, we've been testing an API we developed at TimbaObjects for providing data on trades at the Nigerian Stock Exchange. A number of our clients already use this data in production for some of their applications and we're repurposing this API for public use.

This data service is the first of a number of such data services that we intend to provide to developers who will in turn use this to create valuable applications. With this NSE data API, you get access to data on all stocks that were traded on the Nigerian Stock Exchange on a daily basis.

We're yet to launch this on a private beta basis and we're seeking feedback in the form of a survey on what kind of services or applications will be built using this API. This will give us a sense of the data requirements and help us provide more value to developers who are likely to use this service.

To gain access to this API on launch, please fill ourÂ survey and don't forget to leave your contact information and we'll sign you up when we launch.
